// Upgrade is an ActionReconciler which attempts to upgrade a Helm release
// based on the given Request data.
//
// The writes to the Helm storage during the upgrade process are observed,
// and update the Status.History field.
//
// On upgrade success, the object is marked with Released=True and emits an
// event. In addition, the object is marked with TestSuccess=False if tests
// are enabled to indicate we are awaiting the results.
// On failure, the object is marked with Released=False and emits a warning
// event. Only an error which resulted in a modification to the Helm storage
// counts towards a failure for the active remediation strategy.
//
// At the end of the reconciliation, the Status.Conditions are summarized and
// propagated to the Ready condition on the Request.Object.
//
// The caller is assumed to have verified the integrity of Request.Object using
// e.g. action.VerifySnapshot before calling Reconcile.
